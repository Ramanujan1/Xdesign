This project is written in java using Spring boot framework.

note:
-----
Queries may include any combination of the above features and none are mandatory.

Regrding the above requirement , my understanding initally was that the expectation is to have a single endpoint that takes all the non-mandatory parameters
I then relised that its a lot more usefull to group paramaters that are related into one endpoint and not have all the parameters in one as this would make it not easy to 
maintain.
